       IVS Analysis Report for RD1808 ($18OCT10XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: No met data for KUNMING. The log has only zeroes. 

Parameterization comments: Position of 3C48 must be solved for; offset is
          ~57 mas from the apriori position. 

Other comments: MATERA did not participate due to antenna failure.

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

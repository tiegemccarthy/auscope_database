       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: HARTRAO, HOBART26, and KOKEE did not observe.
          TIANMA65 missed the first 11 hrs due to a problem with DBBC2;
          used the CDAS for the last 13 hrs. Channels X5-X8U/L and S3,
          S5, S6 were deleted due to weak fringes. 

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: None.

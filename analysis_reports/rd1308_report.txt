   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: NYALES20 missed the last ~5 hrs to recool the receiver.
          HOBART26 missed the first ~5 hrs due to a 'day 49' problem.
          Four of the HOBART26 baselines have very little good data and
          were automatically deselected. 

Parameterization comments: WESTFORD's cable cal degrades the solution
          significantly and is not applied. 

Other comments: Observed all 24 class 4 Gaia sources; 19 detected.

V1707/$17DEC04XA
00:00 UTC, DOY 338

Correlated at the VLBA. Fourfit fringed at GSFC using multitone Pcals.
SC-VLBA did not participate due to hurricanes Irma and Maria.
Channel S3 deleted at BR, KP, NL, and OV due to RFI.
Manual phase cals used at Medicina.
Refringed ~450 S-band observations with narrow MBD windows, mostly for
   sub-ambiguities at BR, KP, NL, and OV.
Refringed 11 X-band observations with narrow MBD windows.

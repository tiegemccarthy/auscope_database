       IVS Analysis Report for RD1607 ($16AUG24XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: NYALES20: IF3 failed in the MK4 DAT so there were no X5-X8U/L
          channels. They switched to the DBBC at ~09:33 UTC. The database
          has only X-band channels X1U/L-X4 the first 15.5 hours and then
          all X-band channels for the last 9.5 hours. There is a large 
          clock break at ~09:33 (-188.746 microseconds).
          KOKEE missed the first 5.5 hours due to an azimuth encoder problem. 

Parameterization comments: Cable cals were not applied at HARTRAO and 
          KOKEE since manual Pcals were used. 

Other comments: Observed 33 Gaia transfer sources.

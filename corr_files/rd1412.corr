+CORRELATOR_NOTES

Data were processed with updated versions of difx2mark4 and fourfit that
correctly handle fringe amplitude normalization when correlating 1-bit
vs. 2-bit data, as in the case of WETTZELL in RD1412.

+STATION_NOTES

HARTRAO (Hh/J):  Transferred via e-VLBI.

HOBART26 (Ho/H): Fringed with manual phases due to absence of phase cal.
                 RFI in SR6U -- channel deleted in fringing.
                 X5-X8 fringe amps are ~50% weaker than X1-X4.  Lowered
                   G-code threshold from default 0.5 to 0.4, to reduce
                   number of X-band G codes from ~55 to 7.
                 RFI in SR5U caused seven G codes.
                 Mark 5A recording transferred via e-VLBI.

NYALES20 (Ny/N): Fringed with manual phases due to unreliable phase cal.
                   Phase cal was highly unstable or even absent during
                   many scans due to problem with antenna cable carrying
                   5 MHz to phase calibrator.
                 Transferred via e-VLBI.

ONSALA60 (On/S): Transferred via e-VLBI.

SESHAN25 (Sh/C): Weak fringes in SR4U caused by strong signal at
                   4.01 MHz -- channel deleted in fringing.
                 Adjusted XR7U delay by 56 ns in fourfit to correct for
                   delay offset.

WETTZELL (Wz/V): No valid data before 352-0030 due to problems with Mark4
                   formatter.
                 Valid data were recorded after 352-0030 using DBBC, but
                   they were 1-bit, not 2-bit, leading to a loss of SNR.
                 Missed last six scans.
                 No fringes in XR8U/L due to an error in setting up DBBC --
                   channel deleted in fringing.
                 RFI in SR5U and SR6U caused three G codes.
                 Adjusted XR5U-XR7U delays by 46 ns in fourfit to correct
                   for delay offsets.
                 Transferred via e-VLBI.

Except as noted for individual stations, all stations recorded on Mark 5B.

       IVS Analysis Report for AUA004 ($15MAY09XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: Katherine breaks at ~00:49:23 (+3.3 ns), ~04:56:58 (-26.8 ns),
          and ~08:29:30 (-.9 ns). 
          Very little DSS45 and Tidbin64 data due to limited antenna
          availability; get only first 4 X- and S-band channels.

Parameterization comments: Need to solve for RA/Dec of several sources,
          particularly 0700-465, 1312-533, 1740-517, and 1830-589. 

Other comments: None.

  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

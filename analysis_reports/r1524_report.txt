       Analysis Report for R1524 ($12MAR13XA) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve analysis.) 

Problems: No Hobart12 data first 6 hr. 

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: Matera was fringed with channel S6 dropped but with S1
          retained. This results in some G-codes but no subambiguities. 
          Yarragadee was not correlated; polarization was incorrect most
          of the session.

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

       Analysis Report for T2075 ($11MAR22XH) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve analysis.) 

Problems: Urumqi has a 1 second clock break.
          Crimea has subambiguities in X-band and a majority of
          its data has to be deselected.
          VERAISGK is very noisy; maser may be unstable; the 
          sparser baselines were deselected. 

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: X-band has mixed ambiguities and requires manual 
          ambiguity resolution.

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

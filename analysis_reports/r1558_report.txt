       Analysis Report for R1558 ($12NOV05XA) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve analysis.) 

Problems: Very little data to TC, HB, or KE (except on the HB-KE 
          baseline), which means a weak link between the northern
          and southern hemisphere stations.
          3 hr gap at NY, smaller gap at TC.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: FORTLEZA did not participate due to elveation 
          drive repairs.

       IVS Analysis Report for AOV020 ($18FEB27XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: X-band record #942 (KE-YG 02/28/17:22:25 1424-418) has the
          wrong ambiguity spacing, 33.3 nsec instead of 100.0. It has
          8 channels though, like the rest of the X-band and Solve 
          seems to work okay on it.
          KATH12M and YARRA12M are very noisy.
          KOGANEI has data only for the first ~11 hours; schedule was stopped
          due to some misunderstanding.
          WARK12M has data only for the last ~5 hours; some problem with
          staff scheduling.
          HOBART26 had no usable data because the receiver was inside the 
          focus cabin rather than over the focal point.
          The solution gives large atmosphere adjustments, up to ~2 nsec
          at KATH12M. Gradients were not applied.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: Preliminary release. The SYOWA data will not be available
                until after April 2019.

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

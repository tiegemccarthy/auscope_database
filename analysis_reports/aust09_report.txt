       Analysis Report for AUST09 ($13MAY27XA) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: Yarragadee is very noisy for two reasons. There are only 4
          X-band channels. And the S-band delays are noisy and bi-modal,
          with lobes ~50 nsec apart (subambiguities). Observations from
          one of the S-band lobes had to be deselected.  The station 
          reported 'DBBC channels 5 and 6 look bad in autocorrelations.'
          It may be worthwhile to refringe the S-band. They also 
          reported 11 expected clock jumps, none of which are obvious.

          Katherine's DBBC was dead ~07:00-08:16. A clock break is 
          needed at that time and most of the data before is noisy and
          gets deselected. 

          Hobart12 missed the first ~2 hrs due to antenna controller
          problems.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: None.

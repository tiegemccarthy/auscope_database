       IVS Analysis Report for CRF106 ($18APR04XN) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: Two small clock breaks at YARRA12M, at ~02:38 and ~11:25.
          One clock break at Kokee at ~11:30. 

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: HOBART26 did not observe.
                HART15M used as the refernce clock since there was a clock
                break at KOKEE.

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

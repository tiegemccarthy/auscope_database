       Analysis Report for R4519 ($12FEB09XE) 
   (Analyzed by Sergei Bolotin, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: unknown.) 

Problems: ZELENCHK did not observe; YARRA12M produced about 5 good 
observations at X-band, was deselected; HOBART12 get confused with
a hard drive => early terminated observations (about 1.5hr missed);
just 35 good observations form WARK12M.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: FORTLEZA's baselines have ambig spacing 50ns at the
S-band.

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

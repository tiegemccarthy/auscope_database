       IVS Analysis Report for APSG46 ($20APR07XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: Unlocked BBC's at KUNMING, no signal in channels S2, S6, X2, X3,
          X4, X6. Missing channels caused X-band subambiguities. Channel S1
          was deleted due to low amplitudes causing G codes. KUNMING also
          has a clock break at ~08:32. The HOBART26-KUNMING baseline has a
          very large baseline clock offset.
          YARRA12M's clock is very unstable with many small breaks. Eight 
          breaks were used: 19:22, 22:42, 23:15, 23:45, 10:35, 11:00, 12:48
          and 17:02 UTC. 
          HOBART26 missed most of the first 8 hours. The log has a comment
          about servicing the receiver focus platform.
          KUNMING, YARRA12M and KOGANEI are very noisy. KOGANEI's log has
          many 'ONSOURCE status is SLEWING!' messages. 

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: This is the refringed version. Originally there were many
         X-band subambiguities on KUNMING baselines. The refringed 
         solution uses ~230 additional KUNMING observations.

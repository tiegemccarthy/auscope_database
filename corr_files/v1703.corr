V1703/$17NOV30XA
00:00 UTC, DOY 334

Correlated at the VLBA. Fourfit fringed at GSFC using multitone Pcals.
SC-VLBA did not participate due to hurricanes Irma and Maria.
NL-VLBA recorder failed, no data.
Channel S3 deleted at BR, KP, NL, and OV due to RFI.
Manual phase cals used at Medicina.
Refringed ~380 S-band observations with narrow MBD windows, mostly for
   sub-ambiguities at BR, KP, NL, and OV.
Refringed 4 X-band observations with narrow MBD windows.

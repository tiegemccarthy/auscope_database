       IVS Analysis Report for AUG001 ($15JAN09XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: Sinusoidal cycling pattern seen in the HB-YG and KE-YG nuSolve
          delay residuals; period ~60-90 minutes, amplitude ~300 psec.
          Not obvious on the HT-YG baseline though, but that may be because
          it is noisier and has less than half as many points.
          Yarragadee break at 03:27:48 (-3.4 nsec). 

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: None.

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

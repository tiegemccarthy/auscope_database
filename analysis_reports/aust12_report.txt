       Analysis Report for AUST12 ($13SEP16XA) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Difx correlated at Curtin University.
Fourfit fringed at University of Tasmania.
Databases made at GSFC.


Problems: None. 

Parameterization comments: Used 7/40 clock/atmosphere constraints for
                Katherine (usually 2/40).  

Other comments: The schedule has 3C274, but at the position of M84,
                so the name was changed to M84 when the databases were 
                made. All of those observations failed in one or both
                bands.

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

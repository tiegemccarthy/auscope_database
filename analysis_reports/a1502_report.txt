       IVS Analysis Report for A1502 ($15FEB06XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: The original databases could not be precessed by Solve. Three
           stations (HB, KE, YG) started ~2.4 hrs late, and the first 
           2.4 hrs of the databases had data for only one baseline 
           (Ht-WW). Solve apparently cannot handle such a case. The
           databases were regenerated using dbedit to eliminate the
           first 2.4 hrs. 
          Multiple clock breaks at HOBART12 over a ~1.5 hr period.
           Set a break at 03:37 (-15.4 nsec) and deselected ~1.5 hrs
           of HB data.
          One break at YARRA12M at ~08:15 (-23.9 psec). 

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: None.

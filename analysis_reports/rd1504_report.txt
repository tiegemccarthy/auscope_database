       IVS Analysis Report for RD1504 ($15JUN24XB) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

This release does not include Medicina.  Medicina has not yet been
correlated due to anomalous results from trial correlations that may be
caused by errors in how the VDIF data are being read.


Problems: HARTRAO:  Missed ~3 hrs due to poor time synchronization of Mark5B.
          HOBART26: Mised ~4-5 hrs for 4 windstows.
          NYALES20: Unstable receiver LO phases in many scans caused by 5 MHz
                    antenna cable problem over a narrow range of elevations.
                    Rapid fringe phase variations were corrected second by
                    second by fringing with multitone phase cal mode using
                    only one tone per channel.
          TIANMA65: SR3U and SR6U deleted, MA-T6 has 20 nsec S-band ambiguities.
                    No S-band fringes or phase cal after scan 176-0829.
                    X-band system temperatures started rising at ~176-0720,
                    reaching ~4x their earlier levels by 176-1200, after
                    which they were stable.  Fringe and phase cal amplitudes
                    decreased accordingly by ~50%.
          MEDICINA: Not yet correlated. Recorded on Mark 5C in VDIF format.

Parameterization comments: None.

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

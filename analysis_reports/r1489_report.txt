       Analysis Report for R1489 ($11JUN27XA) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve analysis.) 

Problems: S-band has mixed ambiguities. 
          MA-TS has only 1 S-band channel so it was deselected.
          HB has a clock break during the first hour; all data 
           before the break was deselected. 
          K1 has X and S subambiguities.
          K1 - first 10 hrs of S-band looks sinusoidal. 
          K1 is noisy; only 4 X-band channels. 
          TS is also noisy; only 2 S-band channels. 
          HH has large clock variability.
          This sessions has large baseline clock offsets on many baselines.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: None.

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve analysis.) 

Problems: Katherine: manual Pcals; 2 segments in X-band; clock break
          set at 00:00 UTC.
          Warkworth: namual Pcals; 4 segments in X-band; clock breaks
          set at 20:30, 00:00, and 04:48 UTC. 
          Kokee did not observe because of receiver problems.
          Yarragadee was not correlated due to DBBC configuration error.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: This is a small network with mostly sparse baselines. 
          Consequentially, Katherine and Warkworth are poorly lined to
          the other 3 stations.

       Analysis Report for AUST11 ($13AUG07XA) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Difx correlated at Curtin University.
Fourfit fringed at University of Tasmania.
Databases made at GSFC.


Problems: None. 

Parameterization comments: None.

Other comments: 3C274 is in the schedule with the position of M84.
                Therefore '3C274' was changed to 'M84' when the 
                database was made. However, all of those observations 
                have QC=0 (not detected) in either S-band or both bands.

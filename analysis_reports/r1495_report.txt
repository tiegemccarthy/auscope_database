       Analysis Report for R1495 ($11AUG08XA) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve analysis.) 


Second processing, Parkes added.

 
Problems: Yarragadee was deselected. There is only a little bit of
          noisy data at the start and end on three baselines.
          Yarragadee has only X1-X4 and Parkes has only X5-X8, so
          no PA-YG baseline data. HB-PA baseline shows a bimodal
          pattern, with a secondary lobe ~.5 nsec away.  

Parameterization comments: Clock break needed at Hobart12, due to
          manual phase cal reset. The Parkes baselines show large
          baseline clock offsets.  

Other comments: None.

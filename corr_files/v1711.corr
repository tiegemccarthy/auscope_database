V1711/$17DEC08XA
00:00 UTC, DOY 342

Correlated at the VLBA. Fourfit fringed at GSFC using multitone Pcals.
SC-VLBA did not participate due to hurricanes Irma and Maria.
Channel S3 deleted at BR, KP, NL, and OV due to RFI.
Manual phase cals used at Medicina.
Refringed ~450 S-band observations with narrow MBD windows, mostly for
   sub-ambiguities at BR, KP, NL, and OV.
Refringed 1 X-band observations with narrow MBD windows.

           Vclock, gps delta, UT1-UTC all check OK.
     0000  Begin.

0000-0007 *NL not recording. Mark5C went into "comm lost"     REC   100    7
           state.  Restarted DRS and reloaded the obs, and it
           now looks OK.
     0000 %KP windy.
0221-0223 *KP wind stow.                                      WEA   100    2

0340-0350 *PT got a false -20F ambient temperature warning    WEAST 100   10
           and stowed. (C140864)
     0645  New operator is Alan Kerr
0704-0713 %FD getting doComent alerts for the formatter.      MCB   100    9
           Unsure if data is good. Tsys looks normal. Maser
           is not
           setting MCB address. Timing might be affected.
0720-0724 *FD VME rebooted to clear BBC/formatter problems.   MCB   100    4
           BBC/formatter messages continue. C140868
0724-1358 %FD still having MCB issues, timing may be affected MCB   100  394
           by inability to communicate with maser (C140869)
0730-0903 *PT,MK out for daily USNO observation.              SCH   200  186
0947-1021 *KP out. scheduled power outage.                    COM   100   34
1358-1453 *FD VME not communicating properly.                 HWC   100   55
     1451  New Operator: Karlee Radford
1453-1501 *FD rebooting VME. Found antenna had autostowed,    HWC   100    8
           repointing.

1542-1910 %FD internet communications down. May not affect    COMM
           observation data.

1755-1801 *LA not recording, checking out a disk pack.        TAPE  100    6
1805-1807 *PT power glitched and autostowed.                  COM   100    2

2010-2012 *FD autostowed. Repointed.                          COM   100    2
2022-2205 *FD autostowed, so site techs are taking antenna.   HWA   100  103
     2150 *FD reset the timing.                               TIME

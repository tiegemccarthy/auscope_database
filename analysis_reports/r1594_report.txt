       Analysis Report for R1594 ($13JUL16XA) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: Deselected FORTLEZA since there is very little usable data
          (39 points on 3 baselines) and the position formal errors
          are very large. The Bonn correlator reported: "Almost no 
          fringes in X-band, some more detections in S-band. Most 
          likely the first LO was unstable." 

Parameterization comments: Katherine's clock shows a large diurnal
          variation. 

Other comments: None.

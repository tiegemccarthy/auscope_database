       IVS Analysis Report for A1510 ($15FEB21XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by Sergei Bolotin, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: due to DBBC errors there are no valid data on WARK12M between ~9:00
and 14:00UTC. Also, abnormal clock drift on WARK12M from ~5:00 to 9:00, data
were deselected.

Parameterization comments: clock breaks were added to KATH12M and WARK12M. 

Other comments: None.

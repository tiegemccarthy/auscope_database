       Analysis Report for AUST04 ($12MAR21XA) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve analysis.) 

Problems: Poor performance for Katherine. Only 27 points total on 
          one baseline in the solution. Most of the Katherine S-band
          observations are D (missing channels) and F codes (fork 
          problem). 

Parameterization comments: RA/Dec on for 1613-586 and 1950-613. 

Other comments: Three new sources: 0212-620, 1036-529, and 1511-586.
          Get fairly large baseline clock offset for WW-YG, 175 psec.

V1712/$17DEC09XA
00:00 UTC, DOY 343

Correlated at the VLBA. Fourfit fringed at GSFC using multitone Pcals.
SC-VLBA did not participate due to hurricanes Irma and Maria.
Channel S3 deleted at BR, KP, NL, and OV due to RFI.
Manual phase cals used at Medicina.
Refringed ~800 S-band observations with narrow MBD windows, mostly for
   sub-ambiguities at BR, KP, NL, and OV.
Refringed 3 X-band observations with narrow MBD windows.

           Operator is Betty Ragan.
           Vclock, gps delta, UT1-UTC all check OK.
     0000  Begin.
0000-2354 *SC is out due to hurricane damage.
0000-0005 *OV not recording on first scan, due to having      REC   100   5
           just stopped DRS to check a disk pack.
0033-0035 *FD had Dot_OS_Diff error on DBE 2.                 TIME  100   2
           Value was off by one.  May have something to do
           with the timing having to be reset earlier?
           Resynced the DBE.
0035-0105 *FD had Dot_OS_Diff alert on DBE 2, as well as a    TIME  100  30
           TimestampDifference alert, even though timing looks
           OK on the device browser on both DBEs. Stopping the
           observation, resyncing both DBEs, and restarting.
     0050  FD alerts have not gone away. Rebooting both DBEs.
     0106  FD timing looks OK now.  I will note that it is
           getting the "problem setting formatter" errors
           again, as well, which should not affect data, but
           we are not seeing any other MCB problems recurring.
           Hopefully all is well with it now.
0205-0206 *KP antenna oscillaing.  Put it in standby for      ACU   100   1
           a minute.
     0346 %FD raining.
     0430 %KP windy.

0624-0804 *PT, MK removed for daily USNO observation.         SCH   200 200
     0645  New operator is Alan Kerr
0822-0826 *NL autostow. power glitch. repointed.              COM   100   4

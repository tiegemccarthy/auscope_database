   (Analyzed by David Gordon, Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: KATH12M has a small clock break at ~13:26 UTC.
          ISHIOKA did not participate due to antenna issues.
          KOKEE ran with a warm receiver.
          FORTLEZA missed ~2.5 hrs due to azimuth torque limiter issues.  

Parameterization comments: 3C48 adjusted in the solution; ~59 mas offset 
          from the apriori.  

Other comments: None.

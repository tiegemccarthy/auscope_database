       IVS Analysis Report for AUM007 ($18AUG31XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: HOBART12 S-band is all zero codes (non-detections) after the 
          first ~3.8 hrs due to some configuration issue. A new S-band
          frequency sequence was being used to avoid RFI.
          KATH12M has perhaps a dozen or more small clock breaks, most
          being too close together to use. Breaks are used at 03:18,
          05:58, 14:32 and 16:30 UTC.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: HOBART12 used the VGOS broadband system.

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

       IVS Analysis Report for RD2001 ($20JAN15XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: HOBART26 disk pack failed.
          NYALES20 missed ~11 hours due to motor problems.
          KUNMING halted for ~3.5 hours, reason unknown. 

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: This is a refringed version. The original version required 
          7 clock breaks at HARTRAO. It was refringed at SHAO to apply manual
          S-band phase cals at HARTRAO. The revised version has no breaks.

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,

  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

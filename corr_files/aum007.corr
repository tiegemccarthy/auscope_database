+CORRELATOR NOTES

The AUM experiments are testing the compatibility of the newly installed
wideband receiver on the Hobart12 with the legacy VGOS mode. The Hb data
consists of three datastreams, recorded in dual linear polarisations.
These have been labelled as RCP (H-pol) and LCP (V-pol) for compatibility
with FITS where initial analysis was performed..
Data were correlated using DiFX 2.5.2. Unfortunately, the version of
difx2mark4 included in this release does not support the inclusion of
phase cal information from additional data streams. As such, no useful
phasecal information is present for the Hb station although it was
recorded and extracted.
Hb data were recorded using 32-MHz wide channels though the DBBC3
(X-band) and DBBC2 (S-band, using v105E firmware). Zoom bands were used
to cross-correlate the data. For this reason, no LSB channels were
recorded for Hb. 

From this experiment on, a different S-band frequency configuration was used, using 6 contiguous chamnnels between 2.2 and 2.296 GHz. This range covers all of the RFI-free S-band spectrum for the Hobart site. As such, ambuigity spacing is 62.5 ns, rather than the typical 100 ns. 
There is a large single-band delay difference between the X- and S-band
data, due to these frequencies being sent over coaxial rather than fibre,
and then recorded in a difference formatter. The difference appears to be
consistent and stable over the experiment.
Polarisation combination was accomplished through solving for single
band delays and phases separately and then fringe fitting the Hb baselines
with the "-PRR+RL" options in fourfit.

       Analysis Report for R1490 ($11JUL05XA) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve analysis.) 

   Recorrelated at the Bonn correlator to add Yarragadee.

Problems:  Kashim11 has subambiguities and is very noisy;
           has only 4 X-band and 4 S-band channels. 
           Yarragadee has only 3 X-band channels and not
           much data.
           The KK-YG baseline differs by an X-band sub-
           ambiguity (20 nsec) from the other YG baselines;
           baseline clock needed. 

Parameterization comments: Two sets of manual Pcals were
           used for Hobart12. A clock break term is needed.
           Manual Pcals at KK and WZ, cable cals were not used. 

Other comments: None.

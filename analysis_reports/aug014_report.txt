       IVS Analysis Report for AUG014 ($15APR12XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Analysis report delayed. Karen Baver had to create a special version 
of anl_comments because this session has one baseline with more than 
1000 points (KE-YG, 1009 points used). The larger format caused 
anl_comments to malfunction.
 

Problems: Two clock breaks at Hobart12. The first is ~20 minutes after
          the start, so the first 20 minutes are deselected. The second
          is set at 12:45:27.4 (+0.6 nsec). 

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: None.

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

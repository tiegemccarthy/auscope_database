       IVS Analysis Report for AUA001 ($15MAR22XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: DSS45: Azimuth drive failed, no data.
          Warkworth: no S-band data due to schedule configuration error.
          Yarragadee: break set at 12:46:54 (-2.6 nsec).

Parameterization comments: Several source posistions need to be solved for. 

Other comments: Two new sources, 0007-048 and 0539-543 added to blokq.

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

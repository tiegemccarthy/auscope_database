       IVS Analysis Report for AOV023 ($18MAY21XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: There are many problems with this session. 

          The databases from GSI contain several access codes that interfere
          with the Calc/Solve processing and nuSolve analysis. These had to be
          removed by regenerating them with dbedit. New version 1 databases
          were submitted to IVS. 

          The results are very poor. Both bands are noisy. At S-band, the SNR's
          are low and 27% of the observations are non-detections (zero quality
          codes). The solution actually gets noisier when the ionosphere is
          applied. Scheduled scans were too short, some as short as 20 seconds,
          which is way too short for the antennas involved. And typically several
          seconds are lost during correlation, so observations are as short as
          14 seconds. The emphasis needs to be on getting quality data, not just
          more data.

Parameterization comments: Three clock breaks used at KASHIM11, at 19:29,
          21:06, and 23:31. 

Other comments: None.

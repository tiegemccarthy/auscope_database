       Analysis Report for AUST10 ($13JUL04XA) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 


  This session was correlated at Curtin University, 
  fourfit fringed at University of Tasmania, and 
  databases were made at GSFC.


Problems: None. 

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: Source M84 was incorrectly called 3C274 in the schedule
          file. This was corrected when the database was made. Those
          observations all failed.

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

       IVS Analysis Report for AUA007 ($15MAY13XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: Hobart12 has 4 clock breaks, but only 3 could be used:
          21:52:06 (+2.4 ns), 02:26:02 (-1.8 ns), 06:54:07 (-0.4 ns).
          For the break at ~03:07, ~40 minutes of data was deselected. 
          DSS45 - no data available.

Parameterization comments: The solution was run with RA/Dec on for 6 
          sources (0044-846, 0159-668, 0637-752, 1145-676, 1852-534
          and 2312-505).

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

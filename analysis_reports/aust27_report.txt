       Analysis Report for AUST27 ($14JUN11XA) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: Katherine started with a -2 second clock offset, apriori
          clock term set. Then there is a -1 second clock break 
          between 14:18 and 14:47, clock break set at 14:20.
          Hobart has a small small clock break (-.71 nsec) between
          05:19 and 05:35.
          Yarragadee's data was lost due to module failure.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: None.

  * Recoverable: can be included in the solution. 

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

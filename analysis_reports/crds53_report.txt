       Analysis Report for CRDS53 ($11AUG10XN) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, GSFC Analysis Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve analysis.) 

Problems: Parkes has a small clock  break (.64 nsec) after an ~1.25 hr 
          gap. Its not clear what happened. 
          Yarragadee is very noisy and the YG baselines have large
          baseline clock offsets.

Parameterization comments: Did not estimate gradients because the
          estimates become very large.  

Other comments: None.

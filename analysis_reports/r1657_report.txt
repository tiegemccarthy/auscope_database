       Analysis Report for R1657 ($14OCT13XA) 
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: Many problems!

 HOBART12 has at least 7 small clock breaks, but the software 
 cannot support them all. Breaks are set at 18:15 (+.73 nsec),
 06:25 (-.65 nsec), 09:00 (+1.31 nsec), 11:55 (-.52 nsec), and
 13:27 (-.58 nsec). And ~85 observations have to be deselected.

 ONSALA60 is very noisy and has many zero codes in X-band. The 
 log shows high X-band system temperatures.

 NYALES20's cable cal is bi-modal at times and has a large break
 (~84 nsec), similar to R1655. It is not applied, but this may
 produce some systematic errors since the cable and phase cal
 have an elevation dependence. 

 TSUKUB32 missed the first 7 hrs due to a typhoon.

 YARRA12M mised the first hour due to a power failure.

 FORTLEZA did not participate; problem with azimuth bearings.

 SESHAN25 did not participate; antenna motor problem.

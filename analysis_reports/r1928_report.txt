       IVS Analysis Report for R1928 ($20JAN07XA) 
       This report is the official IVS analysis report that corresponds to 
       the database maintained by the IVS Data Centers for this session.  
   (Analyzed by David Gordon, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Spoolfile source: interactive solve/nuSolve analysis.) 

Problems: SEJONG is noisy. They changed some setting for a polarization
          and LNA test in December and apparently this affected the last
          few R1 sessions. Some refringing was done to correct X-band
          subambiguities and ~50% more observations are used on the SEJONG
          baselines.
          NYALES20 gets only ~6 hours of usable observations. They missed 
          the first ~15.5 hours due to very high winds, and then had to go
          down after a few hours to recool for ~2.2 hours.
          YARRA12M has small clock breaks at ~01:20 and ~11:05 UTC.

Parameterization comments: None. 

Other comments: NYALE13S observed for ~1 hour, but the data is not usable.

  MISSED:     Baseline was scheduled, but at least one of the sites
              did not observe.
  NOT CORR:   Baseline was scheduled but not correlated.
  NO DATA:    The baseline's stations were both correlated,
              but they did not observe together.
  DESELECTED: Usable data was generated for the baseline,
              but the analyst rejected it.

+CORRELATOR_NOTES
This is a re-release with data recovered from the KATH12M disk pack.
WARK12M accidentally used a setup for R1706 with 2-bit mode for scans
265-1730 to 266-0704. The station caught the mistake and switched to 1-bit
mode for scans 266-0717 to 266-1722. Scans 265-1730 to 266-0704 were
able to correlate with WARK12M set to 2-bit mode (and all other stations
in 1-bit mode). The rest of the scans were correlated normally.

+STATION_NOTES
HARTRAO  (Hh/j): Ok.

HOBART12 (Hb/H): Did not participate.

HOBART26 (Ho/h): Station reports scans from 265-1730 to 266-0415 missed.
                 Applied manual phase cal.
                 Channel SR5U and SR6U fringe amplitudes below 50% of
                 average (G codes) and were removed from fringe fitting.

KATH12M  (Ke/A): Applied manual phase cal.
                 Clock break at 265-2127. Applied offset and rate
                 corrections at time of correlation.

WARK12M  (Ww/W): Station reports scans 265-1730 to 266-0704 were run in
                 2-bit mode.
                 Applied manual phase cal.

YARRA12M (Yg/Y): Channel XR6U and XR8U/L fringe amplitudes below 50% of
                 average (G codes) and were removed from fringe fitting.
